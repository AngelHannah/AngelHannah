- 👋 Hi, I’m @AngelHannah aka Hannah
- 👀 I’m interested in making, breaking and coding with C#, learning as I go, finding creative solutions, and maybe making and playing video games(mostly RPG)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Java, Javascript, CSS, HTML5 and a myriad of other languages and frameworks. I also dabble in Unity, GameMaker Studio, and various data-related projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would help me learn more.
- 📫 How to reach me: By email at angelhannah63@gmail.com
